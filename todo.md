## Done:
- [x] Make better error report
    - [x] Let's start with tokenizer.
    - [x] Now for parser
        - Loop based parser,like parsing
            - go for fixing expression
 

    - Add debug statement for rust
## Doing:

       
## Todo:
    - Add generalized types,
        - Literal si used for datatype for now,Have a Value variable for now,TreeWalk will return it
        - A type is a set of types or hashmap of other type,this is runtime initialized,
        - There will be a type container,where we create now type,Now the 
        typecontainer will be a combination of vector and hashmap,The vector contains everything about the type,
        and hasmap links name with the type,Now the name will be a path,which contains 


## Ideas:
    Every objects are global,localization is in the name,the name is connected to a scope,or a path.
