1. Always write on code style,on how the code is written in file.
2. Follow the official language format convention of that language.
3. Always implement small code,Keep it simple,With minimal testing or no testing
,As the implmemtation of the code will change frequently.
4. Keep the code as modular as possible.
5. Always ask on what I wanna do,then do it,other than jumping around writing test.
6. When giving diff,give the line before and after it,so the diff tool can verify the changes.
7. Always prefer move semantics,No clone(or avoid as much as necessary),If there is a clone inside a funcition,Change the funciton signature to own the value,and remove the clone.
So I don't prefer this
```rust
	fn push(&mut self,str:&str){
		self[index]=str.clone()
	}
```
rather this
```rust
	fn push(&mut self,str:String){
		self[index]=str
	}
```
